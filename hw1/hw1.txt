Problem 4
The end contents of in are (5,1,1,1,1). 
I execute funcA until n=0, at which point 
I go into funcB at the lowest level and return 1. 
FuncB swaps the 1st element and the nth element, 
and then changes in[0] to temp, which is in[0] which 
is always 1. This in turn makes a loop filling
 every single element in the array with 1 and 
 swapping the two elements in funcB. 
 That is why the first element is 
 5 because there is no function call so it 
 doesn't get swapped.
